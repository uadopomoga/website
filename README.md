### Adding New Posts via GitHub

2. Go to the `public/content-images/posts/new-posts` directory.
3. Upload your images to the new folder by clicking "Add file" > "Upload files".
   _After uploading, make sure to click "Commit changes" at the bottom to save the images and the folder._
4. Go to the `src/content/posts` directory.
5. Click the "Add file" button and select "Create new file".
6. Fill all the necessary fields as on the template below
7. Name your file with a `.md` extension (e.g., `new-post.md`).
8. Add your frontmatter and content using the template below.

#### Post Template

````markdown
---
title: "Title of your post"
images:
  - src: "/content-images/posts/new-posts/image1.jpg"
    alt: "Description of image 1"
  - src: "/content-images/posts/new-posts/image2.jpg"
    alt: "Description of image 2"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
background_image:
  src: "/content-images/posts/new-posts/image1.jpg"
  alt: "Description of image 1"
cta: "Дізнатись більше"
---

Main content of your post goes here. You can use **Markdown** formatting.

To display multiple images in your post, add them to the `images` array in the frontmatter as shown above. Each image should have a `src` (path to the image) and an `alt` (description for accessibility).

You can reference these images in your content using standard Markdown syntax:

```markdown
![Description of image 1](/content-images/posts/new-posts/image1.jpg)
![Description of image 2](/content-images/posts/new-posts/image2.jpg)
```
